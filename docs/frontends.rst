Creating Frontends
******************

Local Cosmos offers you the possibility to create your own Frontend.

Structure of a Frontend
=======================
Your frontend needs to have the following directory structure:

::

    └── www
        ├── localcosmos
        ├── online_content
        │   └── templates
        ├── fact_sheets
        │   └── templates
        ├── locales
        │   └── LANGUAGE_CODE
        │       └── plain.js
        ├── webapp
        ├── android
        ├── ios
        └── settings.json


www folder
----------
The :code:`www` folder will later represent your Apache Cordova www folder, containing all files of your (web)app.


localcosmos folder
------------------
The :code:`localcosmos` folder is the folder where the Local Cosmos App Kit will put all generated contents, like identification keys, in.
Do not put anything into this folder by yourself, unless you are developing using test content.
During the build phase of your App on Local Cosmos, this folder will be deleted, recreated and auto-populated.

online_content folder
---------------------
If the user creates Online Content in the app Kit, he has to select a template for his content.
You supply those templates in the :code:`online_content` folder of your frontend.
Read `How to write Online Content and Fact Sheet templates`_ for more information on how to write templates.

fact_sheets folder
------------------
If the user creates Online Content in the app Kit, he has to select a template for his content.
You supply those templates in the :code:`fact_sheets` folder of your frontend.
Read `How to write Online Content and Fact Sheet templates`_ for more information on how to write templates.


locales folder
--------------
Contains translations of your apps texts. For each language, a folder using its LANGUAGE_CODE is required. Example:

::

    locales
    ├── de
    │   └── plain.js
    └── en
        └── plain.js

You only have to supply translations for button texts and such. The translations for the user-generated content like identification keys are made
within the App Kit, and are placed in the locale directories automatically during build.

webapp folder
-------------
Holds specific files only for the webapp version of your app.

android folder
--------------
Holds specific files ony for the android version of your app.

ios folder
----------
Holds specific files only for the ios version of your app.

settings.json
-------------

The settings file of your app. The settings.json file has two functions:
    1. it defines which content the user can upload for the Frontend component on the Local Cosmos App Kit
    2. During build, these settings are merged with settings provided by the Local Cosmos App Kit and then made available to your app at www/settings.json

**Example settings.json file**

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "frontend" : "FRONTEND_NAME",
        "PRIMARY_LANGUAGE" : "en",
        "version" : "0.1",

                    "de" : "Freie Seite",
                    "en" : "Free Page"
                },

                    "name" : "Main Navigation"
                }
            }
        },
        "user_content" : {
            "images" : {
                "app_background" : {
                    "restrictions" : {
                        "file_type" : ["jpg","jpeg","png"],
                        "ratio" : "10:16"
                    },
                    "help_text" : "Ratio: 10:16. Will be displayed using the app or webapp on a smarthpone in portrait mode.",
                    "required" : false
                },
                "app_launcher_icon" : {
                    "restrictions" : {
                        "file_type" : ["svg"],
                        "ratio" : "1:1"
                    },
                    "help_text" : "Has to be an .SVG vector graphic AND the ratio must be 1:1. Will be displayed on your phones home screen to launch your app",
                    "required" : true
                },
                "app_pc_background" : {
                    "restrictions" : {
                        "file_type" : ["jpg","jpeg","png"],
                        "ratio" : "2:1"
                    },
                    "help_text" : "Will be displayed in the webapp using a pc",
                    "required" : false
                },
                "logo" : {
                    "restrictions" : {
                        "file_type" : ["svg"]
                    },
                    "help_text" : "Will be displayed on the apps main page",
                    "required" : true
                }
            },
            "texts" : {
                "about_app" : {
                    "required" : false,
                    "help_text" : "Describe your app"
                },
                "app_sources" : {
                    "required" : false,
                    "help_text" : "Sources you used to build this app."
                }
            }
        },
        "android" : {
            "launcher_icon" : {
                "type" : "user_content",
                "image_identifier" : "app_launcher_icon"
            },
            "splashscreen" : {
                "type" : "user_content",
                "image_identifier" : "app_splashscreen"
            }
        },
        "ios" : {
            "launcher_icon" : {
                "type" : "user_content",
                "image_identifier" : "app_launcher_icon"
            },
            "splashscreen" : {
                "type" : "user_content",
                "image_identifier" : "app_splashscreen"
            }
        }
    }

The build process of Local Cosmos adds some settings to this file, like :code:`PRIMARY_LANGUAGE`, according to the settings the app creator made in the app kit.

settings.online_content
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

settings.user_content
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can make your frontend configurable, so the app creator can choose a background, logo etc.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - setting
     - description
   * - user_content.images
     - | Define the images which the app creator can upload using the App Kit. 
       | For example "background_image"
   * - user_content.texts
     - | Define the texts the app creator can create using the App Kit.
       | For example "about_app".
       | Do not add legal notice as this is automatically added by the App Kit as a requirement.



settings.android
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To successfully build an android app, several assets are required.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1



   * - setting
     - description
   * - android.launcher_icon
     - The icon shown on the phone screen
   * - android.launcher_icon.type
     - | Currently, only "user_content" is supported.
       | This indicates, that the app creator has to upload the image using the Local Cosmos App Kit
   * - android.launcher_icon.image_identifier
     - A unique identifier for this image.
   * - android.splashscreen
     - The image shown during app start
   * - android.splashscreen.type
     - | Currently, only "user_content" is supported.
       | This indicates, that the app creator has to upload the image using the Local Cosmos App Kit
   * - android.splashscreen.image_identifier
     - A unique identifier for this image.

Building a frontend with vue.js
===============================

Create a vue.js project
-----------------------
First we will create a folder which contains both the vue.js app and the apache cordova app.

.. code-block:: console

    mkdir lcfrontend
    cd lcfrontend

We will first create the vue.js app. Later, we will build it, and then move the build output to apache cordova.

.. code-block:: console

    npm init vue@latest

:code:`npm init` will ask you for several options. In this tutorial, we named the frontend: :code:`myfrontend-vue`, and this will be the vue.js project name.
You can choose whatever options you wish, but make sure to **add the vue.js router**. The command will create a new folder with the name of your project,
in this case :code:`myfrontend-vue`.

Next, run the following commands.

.. code-block:: console

    cd myfrontend-vue
    npm install
    npm run dev

Take a look at the default vue3 app in your browser to make sure everything has worked so far.


Turn the vue.js app into a Cordova app
--------------------------------------

Create the Cordova project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, install apache Cordova inside your :code:`lcfrontend` folder, not inside your :code:`myfrontend-vue` folder.

.. code-block:: console

    cd lcfrontend
    npm install cordova

or install cordova globally using

.. code-block:: console

    npm install -g cordova

In this tutorial, we assume Cordova is installed locally in :code:`lcfrontend`. If you choose to install it globally, you can use the
:code:`cordova` command directly and drop the :code:`node_modules/cordova/bin/` prefix for all commands.

Now, we will create a blank Cordova app. We use the name of the frontend, :code:`myfrontend`, for the cordova app:

.. code-block:: console

    cordova create myfrontend org.localcosmos.myfrontend MyFrontend

Cd into myfrontend, add the browser platform as well as the device plugin and run the cordova app.

.. code-block:: console

    cd myfrontend
    ../node_modules/cordova/bin/cordova platform add browser
    ../node_modules/cordova/bin/cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-device
    ../node_modules/cordova/bin/cordova build browser
    ../node_modules/cordova/bin/cordova run browser

Check your browser to make sure your blank Cordova app is working. You will see a green blinking **device is ready** area next to the Cordova logo.
This means, your app successfully listened to Cordovas :code:`deviceready` event. We will have to make our vue.js app listen to this event.


Copy cordova js over to your vue.js app
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To turn your vue.js app into a Cordova app, copy the following to your vue.js app.

.. code-block:: console

    cd lcfrontend
    cp myfrontend/platforms/browser/www/cordova.js myfrontend-vue/public
    cp myfrontend/platforms/browser/www/cordova_plugins.js myfrontend-vue/public
    cp -r myfrontend/platforms/browser/www/plugins myfrontend-vue/public
    cp -r myfrontend/platforms/browser/www/cordova-js-src js myfrontend-vue/public

You now have copied the files cordova creates during build over to your vue.js app.
These files will not be part of the frontend you upload to the Local Cosmos App kit later, but are required for development.

An alternative approach is to configure Vite to build directly into cordovas www folder and then use Cordovas commands to preview your app.

Update index.html
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Update the file :code:`myfrontend-vue/index.html` by adding :code:`cordova.js`.

**myfrontend-vue/index.html:**

.. code-block:: html

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />

        <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self' data: https://ssl.gstatic.com 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; media-src *; img-src 'self' data: content:;">
        <meta name="format-detection" content="telephone=no">
        <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight" content="no">
        <meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1, width=device-width, viewport-fit=cover">

        <title>Vite App</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="app"></div>
        <script type="module" src="/src/main.js"></script>
        <script src="cordova.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>


Listen to deviceready
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We want our vue.js app to load after cordovas :code:`deviceready` event has been emitted.
This is a requirement for cordova apps to work properly.
Replace the content of :code:`myfrontend-vue/src/main.js` with the following content.

**myfrontend-vue/src/main.js:**

.. code-block:: javascript

    import { createApp } from 'vue'
    import App from './App.vue'
    import router from './router'

    import './assets/main.css'

    function onDeviceReady(event){

        console.log('Running cordova-' + cordova.platformId + '@' + cordova.version);

        const app = createApp(App)

        app.use(router)

        app.mount('#app')
    }

    document.addEventListener('deviceready', onDeviceReady, false);

To test if everythin worked, start your vite development server with

.. code-block:: console

    npm run dev

The vue.js default app should load, and you should find the following in the console output:

.. code-block:: console

    Running cordova-browser@6.0.0


Comply with the Local Cosmos frontend structure
-----------------------------------------------
Up to now, we simply used the default vue.js app. We will have to alter the project structure to make it work with Local Cosmos.
Remember that Local Cosmos is not restricted to vue.js.
You can write frontends for Local Cosmos with any framework you want, or without using a framework at all.

First, we will create all necessary folders:

.. code-block:: console

    cd lcfrontend/myfrontend-vue
    cd public
    mkdir localcosmos
    mkdir online_content
    mkdir fact_sheets
    mkdir webapp
    mkdir android
    mkdir ios

Next, create the file :code:`settings.json` in :code:`myfrontend-vue/public`` and put the following into it.

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "frontend" : "MyFrontend",
        "version" : "0.1",
        "PRIMARY_LANGUAGE" : "en"
    }


Replace :code:`MyFrontend` with the name of your frontend.


Copy development data
---------------------
Without data or content, you obviously cannot create a frontend. Download the localcosmos development data and put it into :code:`public/localcosmos`.


Localization
------------
Local Cosmos frontends require localization, even if your frontend supports only one language. The reason is the **Glossary** feature.
Every single piece of text can contain a reference to a term in the glossary.

Let's take a look at locale entry with a reference to a glossary entry:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "brush-like rigid bushes, single filaments": "brush-like <span class=\"glossary_link tap\" action=\"glossary\" data-term=\"cmlnaWQ=\">rigid </span> bushes, single filaments",
    }

In this example, the word :code:`rigid` occurs in the glossary of the app and thus is wrapped in a :code:`<span>` with the class :code:`glossary-link`.

As a frontend developer, you might want to display plain text without html that refers to the glossary. For example the text on a button should not contain a glossary link.
Therefore, two files are provided for each localization:

::

    plain.json
    glossarized.json

:code:`plain.json` contains only plain text **without** any references to the glossary. :code:`glossarized.json` contains the same localization **with** links to glossary entries.

As a result of this structure, a localization library which supports namespacing is required. In this tutorial, `i18next <https://www.i18next.com/>`_  will be used.
For implementation, `i18next-vue <https://i18next.github.io/i18next-vue/>` will be used.


Localization with i18next
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
First, download the locale development data and put it into :code:`public/locales`.

Next, install i18next

.. code-block:: console

    cd myfrontend-vue
    npm install i18next-vue
    npm install i18next-http-backend


As localizations are present as files, the http backend is required to load those files using an xhr request. This makes the loading of the localization asynchronous.
As a result, we have to adjust `main.js` as follows:

**myfrontend-vue/src/main.js:**

.. code-block:: javascript

    import { createApp } from 'vue'
    import App from './App.vue'
    import router from './router'

    import i18next from 'i18next';
    import I18NextVue from 'i18next-vue';
    import HttpApi from 'i18next-http-backend';


    function onDeviceReady(event) {

        console.log('Running cordova-' + cordova.platformId + '@' + cordova.version);

        const app = createApp(App)

        fetch('settings.json').then(r => r.json()).then(settingsData => {

            const lcSettings = settingsData;

            app.provide('lcSettings', lcSettings);

            app.use(router)

            i18next.use(HttpApi).init({
                language: navigator.language,
                fallbackLng: lcSettings.PRIMARY_LANGUAGE,
                debug: true,
                ns: ['plain', 'glossarized'],
                defaultNS: 'glossarized',
                fallbackNS: 'plain', // if app has no glossary, glossarized is not present
                backend: {
                    // load from i18next-gitbook repo
                    loadPath: '/locales/{{lng}}/{{ns}}.json',
                    crossDomain: true
                }
            }).then(() => {

                app.use(I18NextVue, { i18next });

                app.mount('#app')

            });

        });

    }

    document.addEventListener('deviceready', onDeviceReady, false);



First, we fetch and parse the :code:`settings.json` file because it contains required information about languages.
We are then making sure that i18next has finished loading before the app is created.

We also made the settings available in the global scope.


Fetching glossarized and plain locale entries in your app
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, the glossarized localization will be fetched.

.. code-block:: html

    <template>
  
        Glossarized (default): <span v-html="$t('WORD')"></span><br>
        Plain text: {{ $t('plain:WORD') }}
    
    </template>


As the glossarized localization might contain a :code:`<span>` element, you always have to fetch it using the :code:`v-html` directive of vue.js.


Configure vite to build for Cordova
-----------------------------------
First, we move cordovas default www folder to not lose it when vite builds.

.. code-block:: console

    cd lcfrontend/myfrontend
    mv www www_default


Next, we configure Vite to build directly into cordovas www folder.

Open :code:`vite.config.js` and add the following to your config:

.. code-block:: javascript

    build : {
        outDir : '../myfrontend/www'
    }


Run your vue.js app on an Android device
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, run the build command

.. code-block:: console

    npm run build

This will build your vue.js app directly into the cordova www folder, as specified in :code:`vite.config.js`.
If you take a look at the www folder inside of :code:`myfrontend`, you will notice that the cordova specific files and folders we copied over to vue.js earlier are present. These files will be added by cordova automatically, so we have to remove them.

.. code-block:: console

    cd lcfrontend/myfrontend/www
    rm cordova.js
    rm cordova_plugins.js
    rm -r plugins
    rm -r cordova-js-src


Connect your android development device to your PC and check if adb has recognized it. The android Sdk has to be installed.

.. code-block:: console

    adb devices

Your device should be listed.

Finally, add and run the android platform

.. code-block:: console

    cd lcfrontend/myfrontend
    ../node_modules/cordova/bin/cordova platform add android
    ../node_modules/cordova/bin/cordova platform run android


If everything worked, you will see your Local Cosmos App built with vue.js on your android device.
