**Column A: Term**

The term is the text that will be automatically recognized if it occurs in a text of your app. A link to its definition is set, so the user can look it up. This term detection happens during ``build``, and therefore can only be seen after you built your app.


**Column B: Synonyms**

One or more synonyms of the term. Separated by the character "|". Synonyms are also automatically detected in texts, just like terms.


**Column C: Definition**

The definition of the term.


3. Uploading data
-----------------
An uploadable ``Glossary.xlsx`` has to be compressed as a .zip file. The content of this .zip file is only the ``Glossary.xlsx`` file.
